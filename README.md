# 🏠 House Price Prediction

## 📜 Philosophy: build Simple, but complete

During my data science training, I’ve come to value a guiding principle:  
**Start with something simple, but make it complete.**

This mindset was reinforced when I attended a talk by an IBM manager.  
His team had been tasked with predicting the outcome of Sweden’s famous ski race, the Vasaloppet.  
Instead of over‑engineering from day one, they focused on defining the inputs and outputs of the model — and then, for the first iteration, simply used a **random number generator** as the “model.”

### 💡 Why This Worked
- **Ready the next day**: stakeholders saw progress instantly.  
- **Business problem addressed**: even with a bad model, the pipeline worked end‑to‑end.  
- **Data source validated**: ensuring correct and accessible inputs.  
- **Parallel work enabled**: front‑end teams could already integrate with the API.  
- **Room for improvement**: the model team could iterate without blocking others.  
- **Stakeholder engagement maintained**: continuous improvement cycles kept everyone involved (think CRISP‑DM).

## ⚖️ The Trade‑Offs

Of course, there are valid counterpoints:

- Shouldn’t you explore the dataset first?  
- Understand missing values or bad data?  
- Perform basic statistical analysis?  

Yes — and these steps are important for a data scientist.  
But in practice, **“simple but complete”** often accelerates delivery, keeps momentum, and builds trust.

## 🔍 Approach

In my first iteration, I’m using a **structured, reproducible workflow** in Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Define** the data science problem  
2. **Gather** data  
3. **Explore** data *(most exploration will be in a separate notebook)*  
4. **Process & Transform** data  
5. **Model & Evaluate**  
6. **Predict** using the trained model  
7. **Answer** the data science problem  

Even in this “simple but complete” version, I’m:
- Using **pipelines**
- Saving **model artifacts**
- Ensuring the project is **production‑ready** from the start

## 🚀 Next Steps

As with the IBM story, this first version is just the beginning.  
The model will evolve, but the **foundation is already in place**.

# Housing Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a home based on its features. It is built using Python and scikit-learn, and is intended to be a simple but complete example of solving a real-world problem with data science.

The goal is to understand the full pipeline: from defining the problem, gathering and exploring the data, building a model, evaluating it, and making predictions.

---

## Project Structure

This repository currently includes:

- `model.ipynb`: Main notebook that builds the modeling pipeline. Includes data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `explore.ipynb`: A supporting notebook focused on data quality checks and exploration. Helps identify issues and opportunities before modeling.

More notebooks and modules may be added as the project evolves.

## Modeling Pipeline Overview

The modeling notebook is broken into the following sections, which is a variation of a structure that was introduced to me during a data science intensive I took at General Assembly in Washington DC:

1. Define data science problem
2. Gather data
3. Explore data
4. Process and transform data
5. Model and evaluate data
6. Save model artifacts
7. Prediction using trained model
8. Answer data science problem

Each section is designed to be clear and beginner-friendly, with comments explaining what each step does.

## 🛠️ Improvements

This section tracks all meaningful updates to the project — new notebooks, pipeline changes, modeling enhancements, and documentation improvements. Each entry includes a short description and the date it was added.

### 📊 2025-09-30 — Added `explore.ipynb` for data quality checks

I’ve added a new notebook called `explore.ipynb` to this repo. It contains targeted data exploration steps to assess the quality and structure of the housing dataset. This includes checks for missing values, outliers, feature distributions, correlations with the target variable (`SalePrice`), and other diagnostics that help improve the modeling pipeline.

This notebook is meant to guide early-stage analysis and ensure that the data is clean, relevant, and ready for machine learning. It complements the main modeling notebook and will evolve as I continue refining the workflow.

### 🧱 2025-09-30 — Revised `pricing-homes.ipynb` with full pipeline improvements

The main modeling notebook (`pricing-homes.ipynb`) has been updated to reflect insights from the data exploration phase. Key changes include:

- Dropping duplicate rows to avoid training on repeated data
- Removing columns with excessive missing values (>30%)
- Excluding zero-variance columns that add no predictive value
- Identifying and dropping high-cardinality, low-correlation columns (likely IDs or keys)
- Applying a log transformation to the target variable (`SalePrice`) to reduce skewness
- Preserving a clean feature set for modeling by filtering based on correlation and structure

These changes improve model robustness, reduce noise, and align the pipeline with best practices for regression tasks. The notebook remains beginner-friendly and reproducible, with clear comments and modular steps.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (e.g. `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `joblib`).
3. Open the notebooks in JupyterLab or VS Code.
4. Run cells step by step and follow the comments.
