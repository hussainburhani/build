## 📜 Philosophy: build Simple, but complete
During my data science training, I’ve come to value a guiding principle:  
**Start with something simple, but make it complete.**

This mindset was reinforced when I attended a talk by an IBM manager.  
His team had been tasked with predicting the outcome of Sweden’s famous ski race, the Vasaloppet.  
Instead of over‑engineering from day one, they focused on defining the inputs and outputs of the model — and then, for the first iteration, simply used a **random number generator** as the “model.”

### 💡 Why This Worked
- **Ready the next day**: stakeholders saw progress instantly.  
- **Business problem addressed**: even with a bad model, the pipeline worked end‑to‑end.  
- **Data source validated**: ensuring correct and accessible inputs.  
- **Parallel work enabled**: front‑end teams could already integrate with the API.  
- **Room for improvement**: the model team could iterate without blocking others.  
- **Stakeholder engagement maintained**: continuous improvement cycles kept everyone involved (think CRISP‑DM).

## ⚖️ The Trade‑Offs
Of course, there are valid counterpoints:

- Shouldn’t you explore the dataset first?  
- Understand missing values or bad data?  
- Perform basic statistical analysis?  

Yes — and these steps are important for a data scientist.  
But in practice, **“simple but complete”** often accelerates delivery, keeps momentum, and builds trust.

## 🏗️ This Project: House Price Prediction
In the spirit of this philosophy, I’m building a portfolio of data and AI solutions for the **architecture, built‑space, and real estate sector**.

For my first project, I’m training a model to predict house prices using the **Ames Housing dataset** — a classic beginner dataset that’s perfect for this exercise.

## 🔍 Approach
In my first iteration, I’m using a **structured, reproducible workflow** in Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Define** the data science problem  
2. **Gather** data  
3. **Explore** data *(most exploration will be in a separate notebook)*  
4. **Process & Transform** data  
5. **Model & Evaluate**  
6. **Predict** using the trained model  
7. **Answer** the data science problem  

Even in this “simple but complete” version, I’m:
- Using **pipelines**
- Saving **model artifacts**
- Ensuring the project is **production‑ready** from the start

## 🚀 Next Steps
As with the IBM story, this first version is just the beginning.  
The model will evolve, but the **foundation is already in place**.
